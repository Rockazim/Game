## Production Server (Digital Ocean VPS)

This repository is deployed on a Digital Ocean VPS that hosts both the game client and multiplayer server.

### Server Architecture
- **Web Server**: Nginx with SSL (serves game files and proxies WebSocket)
- **Game Files**: Deployed to `/var/www/fps-game/`
- **Multiplayer Server**: Node.js running on port 3000 (localhost only)
- **Domain**: hyperfps.xyz with Let's Encrypt SSL certificate

### For Developers - Updating the Live Game

1. **SSH into the server**:
```bash
ssh root@hyperfps.xyz
cd /root/Game
```

2. **Pull latest changes**:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

3. **Deploy the update**:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This will automatically:
- Build the production version
- Deploy to `/var/www/fps-game/`
- Restart the multiplayer server
- Clear CDN cache (if applicable)

### Manual Deployment Steps

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
# 1. Build the game
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to web directory
sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/fps-game/
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/fps-game/

# 3. Restart the multiplayer server
sudo systemctl restart hyperfps-server

# 4. Check server status
sudo systemctl status hyperfps-server
```

### Server Management

**Check server logs**:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u hyperfps-server -f
```

**Restart server**:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart hyperfps-server
```

**Stop server**:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop hyperfps-server
```

**Start server**:
```bash
sudo systemctl start hyperfps-server
```

## How to Test Multiplayer Locally

### Testing with 2 Players on Same Machine

1. Start both the server and client as described above
2. Open two browser windows/tabs to `http://localhost:5173`
3. In the first window:
   - Enter a username (e.g., "Player1")
   - Click "Create Room" and give it a name
4. In the second window:
   - Enter a different username (e.g., "Player2")
   - You should see the room created by Player1
   - Click "Join" next to the room
5. Both players should now be in the same game and can see each other move!

### Testing with Multiple Computers on LAN

1. Start the server on one machine
2. Find your local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
3. Other players can connect by:
   - Opening their browser to `http://[YOUR-IP]:5173`
   - The game will automatically connect to the server

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with optimized files ready for deployment.

## Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" Error
- Make sure the server is running (`cd server && npm run simple`)
- Check that port 3000 is not blocked by firewall
- Verify the server URL in the browser console

### Players Can't See Each Other
- Ensure both players are in the same room
- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify both clients are connected (green "Connected" status)

### Performance Issues
- Lower browser graphics settings
- Close unnecessary tabs/applications
- Try using Chrome or Firefox for best performance

## Known Issues

- Hit detection between players is client-side only (will be improved)
- No persistent scores or stats yet
- Room list doesn't auto-refresh (refresh page to see new rooms)
- Basic player models (capsules) - full character models coming soon

## Next Steps

- Implement server-side hit validation
- Add more maps (Mirage, Inferno, etc.)
- Team-based gameplay (Terrorists vs Counter-Terrorists)
- Weapon purchasing system
- Round-based matches
- Voice chat support
- Leaderboards and statistics
- Custom skins and cosmetics
